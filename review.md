#First of all, great job on completing the task! This is not an easy one and requires quite a bit of engineer thinking to accomplish.
So huge respect to you for taking on the challenge and pulling it off!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here I will add only the comments that are non-contextual and couldn't be added somewhere inline in the code.
Don't hesitate to ask me for more clarifications as needed.

- Running ```go fmt``` and using linters like ```golangci-lint``` [(more)](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) is good practice and encouraged.
Since you are using VSCode you can make formatting run on each save - read more [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33828470/how-to-run-go-fmt-on-save-in-visual-studio-code).
- According to Go style conventions it would be better to use camelCase instead of snake_case for variables. From [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go): 
```
  MixedCaps
  Finally, the convention in Go is to use MixedCaps or mixedCaps rather than underscores to write multiword names.
```
- Don't be afraid to add more new lines to increase the code readability.
- I am very happy to see that you are already using imperative mood - I have encountered senior devs with 7+ years of exp
who don't know what this is. In case you want to read more, here's [this article](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/).

After you finish with all the TODOs I left for you (yes, I am a sneaky bastard), we can have a talk about the solution and potentially discuss how you can do it even better.

Good luck!
